Hello there, I am Jasmeet Singh, an Electronics Student from New Delhi. Driven by the concept of **Project-Based Learning**, I like to get my hands dirty in projects, be it Hardware or Sofware.

Having a keen interest in Astrophysics and Particle Physics I would love to use my knowledge to enhance Space Exploration and help humanity transition to becoming an Intergalactic Civilization.

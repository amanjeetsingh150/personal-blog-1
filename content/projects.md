## S.T.A.R: Satellite Trajectory Animating & Rendering 
**Space | Simulation | Orbital Mechanics | Blender | Python**

{{<figure src="/star.png" alt="star" align="left" width="600">}}

This project is an attempt at creating cool looking yet 'Scientifically Correct Orbital Simulations' for any satellite you want using Blender and Python.
Currently this project simulates around 340 Starlink Satellites launched by SpaceX using a simple 2-body interaction between the Earth & Satellite. 

The future iterations of the project will also take into account various perturbations like the oblateness of Earth, atmospheric drag, gravitational effect of Jupiter etc.

[Watch the Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pl94gpMpK6M) to see the project in action.

The project was trending for a day at the official [starlink subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/gvcnp8/starlink_satellite_simulation_with_blender_python/).

## Real Harry Potter Wand using Computer Vision
**Computer Vision | Machine Learning | Raspberry Pi | Python**

Inspired from the Interactive Wands at Wizarding World of Harry Potter in Universal Studios, this project is a DIY version of those wands made using Computer Vision, Machine Learning, a Raspberry Pi and some other basic electronics. This project allows its user to open/close a box with the correct flicks of a retro-reflector tipped Harry Potter Wand. [Watch the Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DyAehKEF4Q&feature=emb_logo) of the project in action.

The project was well recieved on the [Instructables](https://www.instructables.com/Real-Working-Harry-Potter-Wand-Using-Computer-Visi/) and [Hackster](https://www.hackster.io/jasmeet-singh/real-harry-potter-wand-with-computer-vision-520e3b) community.

The project was also featured on the official blog sites of [Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/take-the-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-home-with-you/) and [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2020/04/05/harry-potter-wand-hack-makes-magic-real/).
The project was also featured in the 'Project Showcase' section of the **'MagPi Magazine'(official Raspberry Pi Magazine)** October 2019 edition.
